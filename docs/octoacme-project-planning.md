# OctoAcme — Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders, Product Owner, Business Analyst, and delivery team
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria (led by Product Owner with Business Analyst support)
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD)
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map (coordinate with Release Manager)
7. Review RACI matrix for role clarity (see [Responsibility Matrix](octoacme-responsibility-matrix.md))
